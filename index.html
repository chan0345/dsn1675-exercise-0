<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>

<p>The usually deep purple roots of <strong>beetroot</strong> are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>

<blockquote>Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, "Battestar Galactica."</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have some <em>weird</em>habits. For instance, <strong>I love beet.</strong>. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them out of their beets.</blockquote>
